      <h1>About Node.js</h1>
      <p>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side, enabling the creation of server-side and networking applications. Node.js was first introduced in 2009 by Ryan Dahl and has since grown to be one of the most popular web development frameworks in the world.</p>
      <p>One of the key features of Node.js is its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model which makes it well-suited for real-time applications such as chat, gaming, and more. Additionally, Node.js has a large and active community, providing a wealth of resources and support. This makes it easy to find and use modules to add functionality to your application.</p>
      <p>Node.js also comes with npm (Node Package Manager) which is the largest ecosystem of open-source libraries in the world. npm allows developers to easily find and use modules to add functionality to their applications, making the development process faster and more efficient.</p>
